<h6>Hey, my name is Vincent and I'm a web developer who’s excited about how the power of the web and its tools can enrich lives. </h6>

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>From a very young age, I’ve always been in love with finding new and creative ways for technology to help improve the lives of people everywhere. Throughout my past, I have used coding and programming as a way to build tools to help others. Currently living in Los Angeles, I started my journey of becoming a web developer through Thinkful’s Engineering Flex Program, learning some of the web’s most important tools. Some of those tools include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. I love creating code that’s organized well and can be expanded easily as I take an immense amount of satisfaction from doing so. Outside my time coding, you can find me reading Sci-Fi books and comics and taking day trips to Disneyland.</p>

    <h6>Star Wars Quiz</h6>
    <p>This app was a beginning challenge from my Thinkful course. The challenge was to make a small dynamic quiz app by using JavaScript to store all the questions and answers in a local object that can be used to display the correct information as well as communicate when the user has selected the correct answer. I chose one of my favorite Sci-Fi universes to base all of the questions on! This simple web app uses a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.</p>
