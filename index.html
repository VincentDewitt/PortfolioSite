    <p class="text_bio">From a very young age, I’ve always been in love with finding new and 
        creative ways for technology to help improve the lives of people everywhere. 
        Throughout my past, I have used coding and programming as a way to build tools
         to help others. Currently living in Los Angeles, I started my journey of 
         becoming a web developer through Thinkful’s Engineering Flex Program, 
         learning some of the web’s most important tools. Some of those tools 
         include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. I love creating code that’s 
         organized well and can be expanded easily as I take an immense amount 
         of satisfaction from doing so. Outside my time coding, you can 
         find me reading Sci-Fi books and comics and taking day trips to Disneyland.

            This app was a beginning challenge from my Thinkful course. The challenge was to
            make a small dynamic quiz app by using JavaScript to store all the questions
            and answers in a local object that can be used to display the correct 
            information as well as communicate when the user has selected the correct answer.
            I chose one of my favorite Sci-Fi universes to base all of the questions on! 
            This simple web app uses a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.
